# Odoo-Unable-to-Unreserve-Fix-Script
Have you been hit with the "It is not possible to unreserve more products of ... than you have in stock." bug? Run this script to solve your issues. *** Test before ruining on a production environment 

## Directory Structure

- `2022/`: This directory contains the original version of the script. It's a command-line based Python script that interacts directly with an Odoo server over XML-RPC.
-  The script prompts the user to input the details of the stock quantities to unreserve and provides the option to overwrite these quantities.
-   For more details on how to use the original script, please refer to the README file within the `2022/` directory.

## Upcoming Features

I am currently working on a major update to the script to include a GUI.This update aims to simplify the process of unreserving stock quantities and improve the overall user experience. Stay tuned for more updates!
I have had Odoo devs, but more actual Odoo users/implementers reach out to me regarding changing to a GUI or web app. The update will be up soon. If you need help or want to dicuss feel free to reach me at
